Recipe Page

Introduction
This project is a Recipe Page â€” a simple, user-friendly web page that displays a collection of recipes, each with its own ingredients list, cooking instructions, and image. The purpose of this project is to continue developing my front-end web development skills while creating a functional and visually organized recipe layout.

What this project demonstrates
Once completed, this project will demonstrate my ability to:

Structure content using HTML

Style and format a responsive, clean layout with CSS

Organize a project with proper file structure and documentation

Write a clear and useful README.md file to describe and reflect on the project
